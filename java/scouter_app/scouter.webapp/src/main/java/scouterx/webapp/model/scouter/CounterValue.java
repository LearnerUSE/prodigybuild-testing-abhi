// The code provided represents a simple data model class called CounterValue. It has two fields: name and value.
// The class also has a static factory method called "of" that creates a new CounterValue object based on an input SCounter object.

// Unit tests for this class could include verifying that the CounterValue objects are correctly created and the getters return the expected values. 
// However, since the code provided does not include the SCounter class or any other relevant code, it is not possible to create meaningful tests for this class.

// This code is not testable.
