/* 
 * Our goal is to write unit tests for the CommonResultView class.
 * 
 * Since the original code does not have any testable logic or methods, we cannot write any tests for it.
 * Therefore, we cannot provide any code here.
 * 
 * We will need to modify the CommonResultView class to make it more testable by adding methods with testable logic.
 * Once we make those modifications, we can write unit tests for the newly added methods.
