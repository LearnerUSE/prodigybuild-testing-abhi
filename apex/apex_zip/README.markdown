Background
-----------

I recently found a number of developers asking questions about Zip file handling in Apex, which as most find out pretty soon, does not exist. Statement governor concerns aside, nor is there any binary data types to make implementing support for it possible. Most understandably want to stay on platform and not call out to some external service for this. And rightly so!

Strategies
----------

I have describe the strategies, components and examples demonstrated in this repo in a series of blogs, the first of which is [here](http://andrewfawcett.wordpress.com/2012/11/04/handling-office-files-and-zip-files-in-apex-part-1/). The second and final part of the series can be found [here](http://andrewfawcett.wordpress.com/2012/12/09/handling-office-files-and-zip-files-in-apex-part-2/). Enjoy!
