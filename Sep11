Your instructions are not specific enough to provide detailed code. However, I'll give you a basic design of a chess game in Python.

```python
class Piece:
    def __init__(self, color):
        self.color = color

class Rook(Piece):
    def __init__(self, color):
        super().__init__(color)
        
class Knight(Piece):
    def __init__(self, color):
        super().__init__(color)

# Repeat for all the other types of pieces...

class Board:
    def __init__(self):
        self.board = self.initialize_board()

    def initialize_board(self):
        # Create the chess board with all the pieces
        pass

class Game:
    def __init__(self):
        self.board = Board()

    def start_game(self):
        while not self.is_over():
            # Play the game
            pass

    def is_over(self):
        # Determine if the game is over
        pass

# To play the game:
game = Game()
game.start_game()
```

Please note that this is just a simple design, chess is a complex game and some additional features to consider would be handling moves, checking for valid moves, handling the player's turn and checking for certain conditions such as a check or checkmate.
