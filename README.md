# ACM Binary Search and BST Demo

The code in this repository implements two fundamental computer science topics: binary search and binary search trees (BST). The code is in C language.

## Setup and Installation

For both Mac and Windows, the software and tools prerequisites are:

* A C compiler: GCC, recommended
* Terminal (Mac) or Command Prompt (Windows) for running the scripts
* A text editor, for editing code files (optional)
* Git, for cloning this repository (optional)

The instructions for setup and installation are:

### Mac

1. Install homebrew:
   `/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"`

2. Install GCC:
   `brew install gcc`

3. Clone the repository (Optional):
   `git clone <repository_url>`

### Windows

1. Install MinGW: https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/

2. Add MinGW to your PATH: 
   a. Right-click on Computer 
   b. Click on Properties 
   c. Then go to Advanced system settings 
   d. Click on Environment Variables 
   e. In System Variables, double click on Path 
   f. Then click on New and add the MinGW path here 

3. Clone the repository: `git clone <repository_url>`

## Running the Code
Navigate to the directory of the code files either `BST.c` or `file1.c` and run the following commands:

1. Compile the code: `gcc -o out binary_search_or_bst.c`
2. Run the compiled code: `./out`

## Environment Setup Information

The code doesn't depend on any particular environment setup as it's written in C. It can run anywhere provided it's compiled with a supporting C compiler.

## CI/CD Pipeline

As the project develops and if any CI/CD pipeline is integrated, relevant information regarding deployment steps required as part of the pipeline will be updated here.
