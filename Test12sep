```python
class Piece:
    def __init__(self, color):
        self.color = color

class Pawn(Piece):
    pass

# Create other chess pieces (King, Queen, Rook, Knight and Bishop)

class Board:
    def __init__(self):
        self.board = self.create_board()

    def create_board(self):
        board = [['' for _ in range(8)] for _ in range(8)]
        return board

    def add_piece(self, piece, x, y):
        self.board[x][y] = piece

# Similarly, create method to move pieces, check state of the game etc.

def main():
    game_board = Board()
    white_pawn = Pawn('white')
    game_board.add_piece(white_pawn, 0, 0)
    # Similarly add the rest of the pieces to the board

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
