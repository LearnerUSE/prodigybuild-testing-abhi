The updated code with unit test cases is as follows:

```python
"""
    Python program to show how to interpolate and evaluate a polynomial
    using Neville's method.
    Nevilleâ€™s method evaluates a polynomial that passes through a
    given set of x and y points for a particular x value (x0) using the
    Newton polynomial form.
