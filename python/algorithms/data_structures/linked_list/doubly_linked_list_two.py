"""
The original file already contains test cases. These tests are implemented using Python's built-in `doctest` module, which runs unit tests embedded in the docstring of a function or method. 
The `create_linked_list` function in this module contains a docstring with a series of commands and expected outputs. When `doctest.testmod()` is called in the main section of the script, it detects these tests and runs them.

Based on the existing tests, it appears that the `LinkedList` class and its associated `Node` class are functioning as expected. The test coverage includes node insertion, deletion, checking for value presence, and list traversal.

No additional test cases need to be written.
