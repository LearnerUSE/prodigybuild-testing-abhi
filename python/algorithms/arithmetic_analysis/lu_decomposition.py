# It seems there is no reference python code available for LU decomposition. Here is a sample python code using latest python version::

```python
import numpy as np

def lu_decomposition(matrix):
    
    # Initialize matrices L and U
    n = len(matrix)
    L = np.zeros((n,n))
    U = np.zeros((n,n))
    
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i,n):
            if i==j:
                L[i][i] = 1  # make the diagonal element of L to 1
            else:
                L[j][i] = matrix[j][i] / matrix[i][i]  # compute L
                matrix[j] = matrix[j] - L[j][i]*matrix[i]  # subtract the computed L from the matrix
                
        U[i] = matrix[i]  # store the updated matrix into U
        
    return L, U
```
