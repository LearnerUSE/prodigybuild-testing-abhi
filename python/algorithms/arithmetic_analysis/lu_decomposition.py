"""
Lowerâ€“upper (LU) decomposition factors a matrix as a product of a lower
triangular matrix and an upper triangular matrix. A square matrix has an LU
decomposition under the following conditions:
    - If the matrix is invertible, then it has an LU decomposition if and only
    if all of its leading principal minors are non-zero.
    - If the matrix is singular (i.e., not invertible) and it has a rank of k
    (i.e., it has k linearly independent columns), then it has an LU
    decomposition if its first k leading principal minors are non-zero.

This function performs LU decomposition on any square
matrix and raises an error if no such decomposition exists.
