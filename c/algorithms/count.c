Since there is no existing code provided, it seems like you need to create a new program. Here is a simple counting program in C:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

void count(int start, int end) {
    for(int i = start; i <= end; i++) {
        printf("%d\n", i);
    }
}

int main() {
    int start = 0;
    int end = 10;
    count(start, end);
    return 0;
}
```
