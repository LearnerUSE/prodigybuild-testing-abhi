Explanation:
The code generates Fibonacci numbers using a loop. It starts with a=0 and b=1, and in each iteration, it calculates the next Fibonacci number by incrementing a by 1. It prints the current Fibonacci number (a) and the next Fibonacci number (b) using printf.

After the loop, it checks if the size of a long data type matches the value of b. If they are equal, it exits the program with status code 1.
