This code is a simple implementation of the Fibonacci sequence generator using a loop. It initializes two variables `a` and `b` to 0 and 1 respectively. It then enters a loop where it increments `b` and `a` and prints their values using `printf`. The loop continues until `b` is greater than `a`. 

Finally, it checks if `b` is equal to the size of `long` using the `sizeof` operator. If it is true, it exits the program with an exit code of 1.

Explanation: The code starts by initializing `a` and `b` to 0 and 1 respectively. Then it enters a loop where it increments both `a` and `b` by 1. It prints the current values of `a` and `b` using `printf`. The loop continues until `b` becomes greater than `a`.

After the loop, it checks if `b` is equal to the size of `long` using the `sizeof` operator. The `sizeof` operator returns the size in bytes of its operand, in this case, `long`. If the condition is true, it means that `b` has reached the maximum value that can be represented by `long`, and the program exits with an exit code of 1 using the `exit` function.
