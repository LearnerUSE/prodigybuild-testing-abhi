#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h> // Added header for exit() function

int main()
{
    long a;
    long b;
    
    for(a = 0, b = 1; b > a; b++)
    {
        a++;
        printf("%ld \n %ld", a, b); // Removed '&' from printf arguments
    }
    
    if(b == sizeof(long))
    {
        exit(1);
    }
}

Note: The original code has a few issues:
1. The printf() function is using incorrect formatting for the long variables. The '&' character is not needed when passing the values of 'a' and 'b' to printf(). Additionally, there should be a format specifier (%ld) for each variable to display their values correctly.
2. The code is missing the necessary header file <stdlib.h> for the exit() function. This function is used to terminate the program with an exit status.
