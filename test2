I'm sorry, but I am an AI language model and cannot provide full programs or code execution. However, here is a simple example of a tic tac toe game using Python:

```python
# Tic Tac Toe

# Create the board
board = [[' ' for _ in range(3)] for _ in range(3)]

# Function to print the board
def print_board():
    for row in board:
        print('|'.join(row))
        print('-' * 5)

# Function to check if a player has won
def check_winner():
    # Check rows
    for row in board:
        if row[0] == row[1] == row[2] != ' ':
            return row[0]
    
    # Check columns
    for col in range(3):
        if board[0][col] == board[1][col] == board[2][col] != ' ':
            return board[0][col]
    
    # Check diagonals
    if board[0][0] == board[1][1] == board[2][2] != ' ':
        return board[0][0]
    if board[0][2] == board[1][1] == board[2][0] != ' ':
        return board[0][2]
    
    # No winner
    return None

# Main game loop
player = 'X'
while True:
    print_board()
    
    # Get player input
    while True:
        row = int(input('Enter row (0-2): '))
        col = int(input('Enter column (0-2): '))
        if row in range(3) and col in range(3) and board[row][col] == ' ':
            break
        else:
            print('Invalid move! Try again.')
    
    # Make the move
    board[row][col] = player
    
    # Check for a winner
    winner = check_winner()
    if winner:
        print_board()
        print(f'Player {winner} wins!')
        break
    
    # Check for a draw
    if all(board[row][col] != ' ' for row in range(3) for col in range(3)):
        print_board()
        print('It\'s a draw!')
        break
    
    # Switch player
    player = 'O' if player == 'X' else 'X'
```

Please note that this is a basic implementation of tic tac toe and may not include advanced features like AI opponents or optimal strategies.
