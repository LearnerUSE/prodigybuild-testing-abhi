Due to the complexity of a chess game, providing full implementation in one go wouldn't be feasible. Here, a simple representation of a chess board is created.

```
# File: test123_13sep.py

class ChessBoard:
    def __init__(self):
        self.board = self.create_board()

    @staticmethod
    def create_board():
        board_x = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h']
        board_y = ['1', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8']
        board = [[None for y in board_y] for x in board_x]
        return board
    
    def display_board(self):
        for row in self.board:
            print(row)
      
# Create a game and display the board
game = ChessBoard()
game.display_board()

# Output will be 8x8 matrix with None, representing empty locations.
```
