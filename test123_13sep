Since the scope of a chess program could be extremely large, here's a simple representation for a Chessboard class in Python.

File: `test123_13sep.py`

```python
class ChessBoard:
    def __init__(self):
        self.board = self.create_board()

    @staticmethod
    def create_board():
        board = [['-' for _ in range(8)] for _ in range(8)]
        for i in range(8):
            if i == 0 or i == 1:
                board[i] = ['P' for _ in range(8)]
            if i == 6 or i == 7:
                board[i] = ['p' for _ in range(8)]
        return board

    def print_board(self):
        for row in self.board:
            print('')
            for spot in row:
                print(spot, end=' ')

chess = ChessBoard()
chess.print_board()
```
